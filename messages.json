At the time, I didn’t fully realize their value, but once I stepped into the real world, everything you said started to make sense. You were always so understanding and supportive, and your patience with me meant more than I can express. I’ll always be grateful to you, not just for being a wonderful English teacher, but for being an even better person. I will always keep you in my prayers for your health and happiness, and I hope you have a wonderful retirement. Students will definitely miss a teacher like you. Thank you for everything! 🙏❤️"

That simple decision made a lasting impact—it helped us improve our communication with the opposite gender, something that continues to help us excel in our jobs today. I have always admired your approach to teaching, and even now, as a psychologist and a soft skills trainer, I incorporate some of the lessons I learned from you into my sessions. You always encouraged and motivated us unconditionally and will always have a special place in my heart. You were not just a teacher but a role model to me. Wishing you a wonderful retirement, ma’am! Thank you for everything. ⭐"

It was the last period of the day and I was the person to read the Report from my group. At the end of my reading, you appreciated our group a lot and called our Report the perfect one. You appreciated me saying 'Good reading' and made my day. You were a teacher who made us get creative. Once you asked us to make a creative bookmark, write down a proverb and tie it up in our English CW. I made a Butterfly bookmark and I still have the notebook till date. Every time I look at it, I remember how amazing of a teacher you were. Once, 'Correcting grammatical errors made in the assembly'  was introduced in the Morning Assembly and we were the first class to conduct one. I was in charge of reading the News for the day. I mispronounced the word 'beat' as 'bet' in Sports news, immediately after which, you corrected this mistake on the Mic. Though a little embarrassed at that time, I never made this mistake of mispronouncing 'beat' in Sports news in my entire life later. You were not just a teacher ma'am, but an impactful teacher. Your smiling face not only eased our pain in class 12 but also made us await the English period every single day. Your lesson on King Tut made me love History so much that I still dream of becoming an Archaeologist. Your activity on researching about a religious place, made me look at my Church from perspectives I hadn't looked before. Your Homeworks to make colorful Bookmarks in Class 11 made me realise that no age is a bar for doing crafts. Your command to spontaneously narrate the story of The Lost Son before the whole class, helped me gain confidence in fearlessly speaking. Your encouragement during ASL recordings made me bold. And the fact that you and I share the same Birth date never fails to remind me of you. Ma'am, as you look back, not only do you have memories to cherish, but lives that you've transformed, people you have impacted and grammars you never failed to correct. Happy Retirement Day ma'am, you will never be forgotten nor will any of your teachings. Trust me, of all the English notebooks in my life, I have my English notebooks of class 11 and 12 only, as they hold a special place in my life."

I cannot thank you enough for being so kind towards my amateur work, when now I know it was far off from anything I would proceed to read. I am very grateful to have been under your guidance and thankful that you are still my inspiration. I would love for us to share our experiences with literature. With all the love I am capable of, I wish you a happy retirement."

Your faith in us, even when we didn’t always deserve it, meant everything. You made sure they didn’t lose hope, and honestly, that made us not lose hope in ourselves either. Looking back, we realize how lucky we were to have a teacher who not only taught us English but also stood by us when we needed it the most. Thank you for believing in us, guiding us, and for all the times you saved us (literally!). Wishing you the happiest and most peaceful retirement!"
